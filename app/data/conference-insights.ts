  "Big 12": "Known for a physical, high-intensity style with elite defenses. Teams are battle-tested against some of the best competition in the country, often making them resilient in close tournament games.",
  "Big Ten": "Historically characterized by a physical, 'grind-it-out' style of play. Teams often feature strong post play and disciplined defense, though they sometimes struggle against faster, space-and-pace offenses.",
  "SEC": "Features some of the most athletic and fastest-paced teams in the country. Expect high-scoring transition offenses and aggressive pressure defense, which can overwhelm unprepared opponents.",
  "ACC": "A league with a rich history of tournament success. Styles vary, but the conference is known for having future NBA talent and teams that peak specifically for March.",
  "Big East": "A basketball-centric powerhouse league. Teams are known for toughness, grit, and playing a physical brand of basketball that translates well to tournament play.",
  "Pac-12": "Often undervalued, this conference features teams that play a more free-flowing, offensive-minded game. Their athleticism can pose matchup problems for more rigid defensive teams.",
  "Mountain West": "A multi-bid mid-major league that often produces dangerous seeds. Playing at altitude gives some teams a conditioning edge, and they are frequently under-seeded relative to their metrics.",
  "WCC": "Top-heavy via Gonzaga and Saint Mary's. The top teams are elite and can beat anyone, often playing a highly efficient, disciplined style that minimizes mistakes.",
  "American": "A physical, athletic league that bridges the gap between mid-major and high-major. Teams here are often scrappy and excellent on the defensive glass.",
  "Atlantic 10": "A diverse league that often produces 'Cinderella' candidates. Teams are usually veteran-led and guard-oriented, which is a recipe for upset wins in March.",
  "Mid-American": "MAC teams are known for fast-paced, guard-heavy offenses. They can score in bunches, making them dangerous 13 or 14 seeds capable of an upset.",
  "Ivy League": "Smart, slower-paced teams that rely on spacing, back-door cuts, and 3-point shooting. They are disciplined and rarely beat themselves, often frustrating more athletic opponents.",
  "Missouri Valley": "One of the most respected mid-major leagues. Teams play 'Valley Tough'—hard-nosed defense and efficient offense. They historically perform very well as underdogs.",
